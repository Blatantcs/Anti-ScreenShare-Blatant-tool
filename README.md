# Anti-ScreenShare-Blatant-tool
BLATANT anti-screen sharing tool this is an example of a blatant bypass, after running the app, no TRACKING apps will be able to run while the app is still running, making screen sharing TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE, scanners will not get through nor will others.

I will update soon and this method will be fileless, and even if you change the title or name of the process it will still work.
